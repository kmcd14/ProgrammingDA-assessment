    "NumPy, which is short for Numerical Python,  is an open source project created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. In Python, Numpy is the fundamental library in scientific computing [1]. It forms the foundations that some of the most important data analytics (pandas) and machine learning (scikit-learn) deploy.\n",
    "At the core of Numpy are multidimensional array object (ndarry). It also provides various derived objects (e.g. masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic) statistical operations, random simulation and much more [2].\n",

    "NumPy arrays are stored in one continuous place in memory unlike Python lists, this makes accessing and manipulate much more efficent. This is incredibly important when working with large amounts of data. Array's also provide many more methods and functions which make working with them \"easier\".\n",

    "The advantages of using Numpy:\n",
    "- Speed: NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds.\n",
    "- Fewer loops: NumPy helps you to reduce loops and keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices.\n",
    "- Clearer code: Without loops, your code will look more like the equations you’re trying to calculate.\n",
    "- Better quality: There are thousands of contributors working to keep NumPy fast, friendly, and bug free. [3]"

    "Randomness has many uses in science, art, statistics, cryptography, gaming, gambling, and other fields. For example, random assignment in randomized controlled trials helps scientists to test hypotheses, and random numbers or pseudorandom numbers help video games such as video poker. Many elements of statistical practice depend on randomness via random numbers. Where those random numbers fail to be actually random, any subsequent statistical analysis may suffer from systematic bias. Elements of statistical practice that depend on randomness include: choosing a representative sample of the population being examined,[7]\n",
