<h2><b><u><p id='Description'> Description</b></u></p></h2>
This document is relating to numpy.random assessment for Programming For Data Analysis module. The aim of this project is to research and investigate the numpy.random package.

This README contains the documentation for technologies and libraries used for the project. 

The Jupyter Notebook and images used can be found at https://github.com/kmcd14/ProgrammingDA-assessment.
<br></br>

 <h4><u> Objectives and to do list: </u></h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Explain the overall purpose of the package.</li>
  <li>Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. </li>
  <li>Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.</li>
  <li>Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b><u><p id='Libraries_Used'>Libraries Used:</b></u></p></h3>

<i>“Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991”</i> (Python Institute, 2021). It is suitable for research, prototyping and building production systems, which eliminates the need for using different languages for both. Python has a vast and continuously growing library to choose from which makes it perfect for data analysis, such as Numpy and Pandas. It is a robust, flexible and efficient language which provides many solutions and avenues to approach and solve problems.

<u><b>Numpy</b></u> is a Python library used for working with arrays. It produces a narray object. Numpy arrays are faster and more efficient than using python lists. It does this by storing arrays in one place in memory, so they can be accessed and manipulated quickly http://www.numpy.org/

<u><b>Mathplotlib</b></u> is a python library used to create plots, graphs, charts etc. https://matplotlib.org/

<u><b>Seaborn</b></u> is based on matplotlib and is also used to create data visualisations. “It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.” https://seaborn.pydata.org/


<b>If your system does not have these libaries installed enter the below command from the command line: </b>

```
    $pip install <library name>
```
